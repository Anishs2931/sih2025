# ðŸš€ Quick Location Setup (Optional)

Your location feature is working with IP-based detection! For more accurate GPS-based location, you can optionally set up Google Maps API.

## Current Status: âœ… Working with IP Detection
- **IP Location**: Detects city/state from internet connection
- **Fallback**: Always works without additional setup
- **Accuracy**: City-level accuracy

## Optional: Enhanced GPS Location Setup

### Step 1: Get Free Google Maps API Key
1. Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create new project: "QuadraTech"
3. Enable "Geocoding API"
4. Create API Key
5. Copy the key

### Step 2: Configure Backend
1. Open `backend/.env` file
2. Replace: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here`
3. Restart backend server

### Step 3: Benefits of GPS Setup
- **Precise Location**: Exact municipality/ward detection
- **Real-time Updates**: Location updates as user moves
- **Better Accuracy**: Street-level precision for issue reporting

## Testing
- **Current**: IP-based location works out of the box
- **With GPS**: More accurate neighborhood detection
- **Free Tier**: 40,000 requests/month (more than enough)

Your app works perfectly without this setup! GPS is just for enhanced accuracy. ðŸŒŸ
